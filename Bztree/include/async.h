  /// For performance purposes, contexts are initially stack allocated so as to
  /// avoid allocation overhead if the operation does not go async. DeepCopy
  /// is called only if the operation is preparing to go async.
  ///
  /// WARNING: there are two serious subtleties to this call that callers and
  /// implementors should be aware of:
  /// 1. If this context contains contexts nested within those DeepCopy is
  ///    invoked on those as well, so that all of the contexts transitively
  ///    nested within are copied.
  /// 2. If this context already came from a prior DeepCopy, then the call
  ///    should return this same context without copying it. This is to handle
  ///    the case that this context was already copied to the heap by a prior
  ///    operation that went asynchronous but which didn't invoke the callback
  ///    that cleans up the copy of the context. For example, this can happen
  ///    if an operation is restarted after an asynchronous IO: if the
  ///    operation goes asynchronous again, then the callback context
  ///    shouldn't be copied to the heap a second time.
  ///

  /// was successful, but some other part of scheduling an asynchronus
